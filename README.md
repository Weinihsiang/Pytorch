# Pytorch
In my PyTorch repository, I have curated a collection of code and projects focused on artificial neural networks (ANN), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural networks (RNN). These architectures are specifically designed for various machine learning tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and sequential data analysis.

Within the repository, you will find implementations of different ANN architectures, such as feed-forward networks, multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), and deep neural networks (DNNs). These models are capable of learning patterns and making predictions based on input data. Additionally, I have included CNN architectures that leverage their ability to extract features from images and videos, enabling tasks like object detection, image classification, and image generation.

For tasks involving sequential data, such as text analysis or speech recognition, I have implemented RNN architectures. These models excel at capturing temporal dependencies and processing sequential information. Whether it's a simple recurrent neural network (RNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), or a more advanced variant like a gated recurrent unit (GRU), the repository covers a range of RNN architectures.

In addition to the architecture implementations, the repository also includes training scripts and utilities to facilitate the training process. I have provided code snippets for data preprocessing, model initialization, loss function selection, and optimization algorithms like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam.

To complement the code, I have incorporated lab notebooks or documentation that outline the theory and concepts behind each architecture. This allows for a comprehensive understanding of the models and their applications. The repository aims to serve as a valuable resource for anyone interested in deep learning and PyTorch, providing a solid foundation for exploring and experimenting with ANN, CNN, and RNN architectures.
